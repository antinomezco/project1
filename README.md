# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This a small web project for the CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

It's a small book database in which you can search using ISBN,
author name or book name. It shows up a list of results and after clicking on
any of them (if they're any results), it brings you to a more detailed book page
that shows additional details such as the amount of reviews, the average
rating from Goodreads(both using its API), along with other user reviews and
ratings. If your username hasn't uploaded a review, a text box will appear
allowing you to add it, along with a number rating.

What's contained in each file?

.env (not shown in github): automatically added environmental variables for the
virtual environment.

.gitignore: file that indicates files to be ignored while uploading to github.

application.py: main flask file, contains all of the necessary background code.
(for more information, check the file itself, the code is well commented)

same directory extend from and inherit, including bootstrap styles.

it'll compare your password with the user's hashed password in the database.

to log back in

both the password and password confirmation need to be the same and 8+
characters long.
